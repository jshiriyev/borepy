"""
The dual water model proposes that two distinct waters can be found in the pore space.
Close to the surface of the grains, bound water of resistivity RwB is encountered. This
water is fresher (more resistive) than the remaining water farther away from the grain
surface. This far water of resistivity RwF is more saline (less resistive) than the
bound water and is free to move in the pores. The model suggests that the amount of
bound water is directly related to the clay content of the formation. Therefore,
as clay volume increases, the portion of the total porosity occupied by bound water increases.
